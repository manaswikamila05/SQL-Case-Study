- Commodity_id in the price_details table and id in commodities_info table will be used to apply to join between these tables. 

- Id acts as a unique identifier between the price_details and region_info tables. 

- Note that there is only one price for a particular commodity variety for a month. This means that the price does not change within the month for a commodity corresponding to a commodity_id.
